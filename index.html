      <p>The horse is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an
        odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The
        horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small
        multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of
        today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their
        domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in
        the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated
        populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations
        are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that
        have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse,
        a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is
        an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related
        concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors,
        markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.</p>

      <h1>Horses are adapted:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>to run</li>
        <li>allowing them to quickly escape predators</li>
        <li> possessing an excellent sense of balance and a strong
          fight-or-flight response</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>Lifespan and life stages</p>
      <p>Depending on breed, management and environment, the modern domestic
        horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years.[7] Uncommonly, a few
        animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond.[8] The oldest
        verifiable record was "Old Billy", a 19th-century horse that lived to
        the age of 62.[7] In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in
        Guinness World Records as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007
        at age 56.[9] Regardless of a horse or pony's actual birth date, for
        most competition purposes a year is added to its age each January 1 of
        each year in the Northern Hemisphere[7][10] and each August 1 in the
        Southern Hemisphere.[11] The exception is in endurance riding, where the
        minimum age to compete is based on the animal's actual calendar age.[12]
        The following terminology is used to describe horses of various ages:</p>

            <td style="width: 260.633px;">A foal of either sex less than one
              year old. A nursing foal is sometimes called a suckling and a foal
              that has been weaned is called a weanling.[13] Most domesticated
              foals are weaned at five to seven months of age, although foals
              can be weaned at four months with no adverse physical effects.[14]</td>
            <td style="width: 361.667px;">A horse of either sex that is between
              one and two years old.</td>
            <td> A male horse under the age of four.[16] A common terminology
              error is to call any young horse a "colt", when the term actually
              only refers to young male horses</td>
            <td> A female horse under the age of four.</td>
